    <div> What is the nature of teaching introductory philosophy? Its not exclusively teaching philosophical know-how, nor is it exclusively teaching a subject matter by passing down knowledge. Rather, I argue, it is an activity similar to Greek tragedy as Aristotle understood it, where a teacher represents a dialectic with the aim of cognitive illumination, enducing curiosity and wonder through a specific process or lecture plot. Some insights from Aristotle's observations about plot tragedy apply to teaching philosophy. Drawing from dramaturgy and fine art more generally, we can better understand good lecture design and diagnose imperfections. </div>
